# APP DESCRIPTION: 
The Star Wars-themed web app lets users explore Star Wars characters using data from the SWAPI (Star Wars API). It is built with Express using Handlebars for dynamic content and has an interactive interface styled with CSS.

## Features: 
- **Home Page:** A Star Wars-themed page with a cool text in scrolling effect.
- **Characters Page:** Displays a list of character cards from the Star Wars universe. Each card has details about the character and links to the Vehicles page. Supports pagination.
- **Vehicles Page:** Displays detailed information about Star Wars vehicles and vehicle starships associated to the character.

## Setup instructions:
1. Extract the zip file.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.
The server will be available at: http://localhost:3000, where you'll find the home page.

## Technologies used: 
- **SWAPI:** Star Wars API used to fetch character, vehicle, and starship data.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for server-side processing.
- **Express.js:** Backend framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **Express-Handlebars:** Templating engine for dynamic HTML rendering.
- **Axios:** HTTP client for making API requests to SWAPI.
- **CSS:** Custom styles for a Star Wars-themed user interface.

## Future Enhancements:
- Implement Redis caching for faster API responses.
- Use AJAX for smoother, dynamic content updates without page reloads.
- Add a back button on the Vehicles page for easier navigation.
- Improve error handling and display more user-friendly messages.
- Enhance design using React, Bootstrap, or Tailwind CSS.
- Add filtering and search functionality for characters and vehicles.
- Improve Code Comments: Add more details for better understanding of the code logic and functionality.

## My WHY: 
- I’m excited about the opportunity to join the Stevens Platform Team because it allows me to contribute to a vital resource that helps students navigate the often intimidating process of starting school. Being part of a project that provides clarity and support to incoming students gives me a strong sense of purpose and fulfillment.
- I enjoy web development because it combines logic and creativity—two things I'm passionate about. I'm also eager to explore AI implementation and learn how to use it to improve our work. Currently, I'm focused on building expertise in these two tech fields to expand my skills.
- Working with a collaborative and agile team and engaging with large codebases will help me grow as a developer while providing insights into real-time functionality and problem-solving. I look forward to making a meaningful impact on the student experience at Stevens.

## About me: 
I’m a third-semester Computer Science graduate student with two years of experience as a software engineer. I think continuous learning and problem solving is fun!
